Bug,Minor,2.18.0,camel-swagger,None,Patch Available,Unknown,Resolved,Fixed,"2.17.5, 2.18.2, 2.19.0",Claus Ibsen,Bob Paulin,2016-12-14T14:42:08+0000,1481744528,2016-12-15T14:26:13+0000,1481829973,2016-12-14T15:31:58+0000,1481747518,"Assume I have rest path

    
    
    rest(""/test"").get().type(ClassA.class).to(""direct:someRoute"");
    
    rest(""/testSub"").get().type(ClassB.class).to(""direct:someOtherRoute"");
    

And in the type ClassA contains a reference to ClassB.

Within the Swagger Doc the path for ClassA renders as expected:

    
    
    /test:
        get:
          responses:
            200:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/definitions/ClassA'
    

However ClassB gets a string parameter scheme

    
    
     
    /testSub:
        get:
          responses:
            200:
              schema:
                 type : 'string'
                 format : 'com.ClassB'
    

However I'd expect it to be:

    
    
    /testSub:
        get:
          responses:
            200:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/definitions/ClassB'
